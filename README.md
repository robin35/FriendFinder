# FriendFinder

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project is a compatibility-based friend application.

Here’s how it works:

    Initial Load:
    	The initial load is to the home page.
    	Clicks the "Go to Survey" button to get started.

    Survey Page:
    	The user will be presented with 10 questions to answer.  
    	All questions must be completed before submitting the survey.  An alert will pop-up if an answer is mission.  
    	The best match is calculated by finding the friend with the minimal difference in scores.
    	A modal is then displayed showing you your best match.
    
This project is for everyone.  Enjoy!
